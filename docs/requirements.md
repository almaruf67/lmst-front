Build a Mini School Attendance System with AI-assisted development workflow documentation.
Requirements

Part 1: Laravel Backend (60%)

Create a REST API with these features:

1. Student Management
   • Model: Student (name, student_id, class, section, photo)
   • CRUD endpoints with validation
   • Use Laravel Resource for API responses
2. Attendance Module
   • Model: Attendance (student_id, date, status, note, recorded_by)
   • Bulk attendance recording endpoint
   • Query optimization for attendance reports
   • Generate monthly attendance report (eager loading required)
3. Advanced Features
   • Implement a Service Layer for attendance business logic
   • Add a custom Artisan command: attendance:generate-report {month} {class}
   • Use Laravel Events/Listeners for attendance notifications
   • Implement Redis caching for attendance statistics

Part 2: Vue.js Frontend (30%)

Create a simple SPA:

1. Student List Page
   • Display students with search/filter by class
   • Pagination (use Laravel pagination)
2. Attendance Recording Interface
   • Select class/section, load students
   • Mark attendance (Present/Absent/Late) with bulk action
   • Show real-time attendance percentage
3. Dashboard
   • Display today’s attendance summary
   • Monthly attendance chart (use Chart.js or similar)

Project-specific conventions (Nuxt 4 + TS)

- Dev/preview on port `3009` (`pnpm dev` / `pnpm preview`)
- Runtime API base: `useRuntimeConfig().public.apiBase` (default `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`); set `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in `.env`
- Structure under `app/`: pages, layouts, components, composables (`useXxx`), stores (Pinia), plugins, assets
- Build UI with mocks first; wire API at the end by swapping mock calls to axios with `apiBase`

Part 3: AI Development Documentation (10%)

Create a AI_WORKFLOW.md file documenting:

1. Which parts you used AI assistance for (Claude Code/Cursor/ChatGPT)
2. 3 specific prompts you used and how they helped
3. How AI improved your development speed
4. What you manually coded vs AI-generated

Technical Requirements
• Laravel 10+, Vue 3 (Composition API preferred)
• Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL with proper migrations
• Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (simple token-based)
• Follow SOLID principles
• Write at least 3 unit tests for critical features
• Frontend type safety: `pnpm typecheck` must pass; lint and format clean
• Docker setup (optional but impressive)
• Clean Git history with meaningful commits

Evaluation Criteria
• Code quality and architecture (30%)
• Feature completeness (25%)
• AI tool utilization effectiveness (15%)
• Vue.js implementation (15%)
• Testing & documentation (15%)
